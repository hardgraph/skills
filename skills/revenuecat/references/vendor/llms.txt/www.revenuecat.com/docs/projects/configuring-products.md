After creating your RevenueCat project, you need to configure what users can purchase and what access they receive. This takes about 5-10 minutes.

## Overview

RevenueCat uses three concepts to manage purchases:

1. **Products** - The individual items users purchase (e.g., "Monthly Premium")
2. **Entitlements** - The access level users receive (e.g., "premium")
3. **Offerings** - How you group and display products in your app (optional but recommended)

**The flow:** User purchases a **Product** → Unlocks an **Entitlement** → You check the entitlement to grant access.

## 1. Choose Your Product Type

Your project comes with a **Test Store** automatically configured. This lets you create products and test purchases immediately—no App Store or Google Play account required.

### For Development: Use Test Store

- Create products directly in RevenueCat
- Test purchases work instantly
- No real money charged
- Perfect for building and testing your integration

### For Production: Configure Real Stores

Before submitting to app stores, you must configure products in:

- [Apple App Store Connect](https://www.revenuecat.com/docs/getting-started/entitlements/ios-products)
- [Google Play Console](https://www.revenuecat.com/docs/getting-started/entitlements/android-products)
- [Amazon Appstore](https://www.revenuecat.com/docs/getting-started/entitlements/amazon-product-setup)
- [Stripe](https://www.revenuecat.com/docs/getting-started/entitlements/stripe-products) or [Paddle](https://www.revenuecat.com/docs/getting-started/entitlements/paddle-products) for web

Then import those products into RevenueCat.

## 2. Create Products

### With Test Store (Quickest Start)

1. Go to your project dashboard
2. Navigate to **Product catalog → Products**
3. Select the **Test Store** tab
4. Click **+ New** to create a product
5. Configure the product details (name, identifier, price, duration)

### With Real Stores

1. Create products in your store (Apple, Google, Amazon, Stripe, Paddle)
2. In RevenueCat, go to **Product catalog → Products**
3. Select your store's tab
4. Import or manually add the product using the store's product identifier

## 3. Create Entitlements

Entitlements represent the access levels in your app (like "premium", "pro", or "gold").

1. Navigate to **Product catalog → Entitlements**
2. Click **+ New**
3. Enter an identifier (e.g., "premium") - you'll use this in your code
4. Add a description

Most apps need just one entitlement. Create multiple only if you have different tiers (e.g., "gold" vs "platinum").

## 4. Attach Products to Entitlements

Link your products to entitlements to define what purchases unlock.

1. In the Entitlements page, click on your entitlement
2. Click **Attach** in the Products section
3. Select the product(s) that should unlock this entitlement
4. Save

Now when a user purchases that product, they'll automatically have access to the entitlement.

## 5. Create Offerings (Recommended)

Offerings let you group products and change what's displayed without app updates. Required if you want to use RevenueCat Paywalls, Experiments, or Targeting.

1. Navigate to **Product catalog → Offerings**
2. Click **+ New**
3. Give it an identifier (e.g., "default")
4. Add Packages—these group equivalent products across platforms (e.g., monthly subscriptions from iOS and Android)

The offering marked as "default" is automatically returned as `currentOffering` in the SDK.

## What's Next

With your products configured, you're ready to:

1. **[Install the SDK](https://www.revenuecat.com/docs/getting-started/installation)** - Add RevenueCat to your app
2. **[Create a Paywall](https://www.revenuecat.com/docs/tools/paywalls)** - Design how users see your products
3. **[Make your first test purchase](https://www.revenuecat.com/docs/getting-started/quickstart#5-make-a-purchase)** - Verify everything works
