# Cloudflare Agents Integration
URL: /docs/integrations/frameworks/cloudflare-agents/overview

Wire Cloudflare's stateful agent framework into a React chat UI with assistant-ui via the standard AI SDK runtime. WebSocket transport, server-side persistence, tool calling, all preserved.

[Cloudflare Agents](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agents/) is Cloudflare's framework for stateful AI agents that run on Durable Objects at the edge. Each agent owns its own SQLite-backed message history, exposes a WebSocket channel for low-latency streaming, and can call tools (server-side or client-side).

> [!info]
>
> This is an integration guide, not a runtime adapter. assistant-ui does not ship a `@assistant-ui/react-cloudflare-agents` package. `@cloudflare/ai-chat`'s `useAgentChat` returns a structural extension of the AI SDK's `useChat`, so the existing [AI SDK runtime](/docs/runtimes/ai-sdk/v7) consumes it directly.

## Architecture

Cloudflare Agents handles the server half: a Durable Object subclasses `AIChatAgent` from `@cloudflare/ai-chat`, owns the message history, and streams responses back over a WebSocket. `@cloudflare/ai-chat/react`'s `useAgentChat` hook wraps that WebSocket and exposes the same `messages`, `sendMessage`, `regenerate`, `status`, `stop`, `setMessages`, `addToolOutput` surface that the AI SDK's `useChat` does, plus a few Cloudflare-specific extras (`clearHistory`, `isServerStreaming`, `isToolContinuation`).

assistant-ui handles the client half. `useAISDKRuntime` from [`@assistant-ui/react-ai-sdk`](/docs/runtimes/ai-sdk/v7) reads exactly those AI SDK methods off whatever you pass in, so feeding it `useAgentChat`'s return value yields a fully-featured runtime: streaming, tool calling, edit, reload, history import and export, attachments, suggestions.

Shared adapters (attachments, speech, feedback, history) work the same way as described in [adapters](/docs/runtimes/concepts/adapters). Multi-thread support needs a [custom thread list](/docs/runtimes/concepts/threads) wired around `useAISDKRuntime`; [AssistantCloud](/docs/cloud) integrates via `useChatRuntime` (which constructs its own `useChat` internally) and is not compatible with the `useAgentChat` wiring shown here.

## Requirements

- A Cloudflare account with Workers enabled and `wrangler` installed.
- A frontend project (Next.js or any other AI-SDK-compatible React app).
- Model API keys (`OPENAI_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, etc.) configured as Worker secrets.

## Setup

The setup has two halves. Steps 1 to 4 happen in the **Worker** project (Cloudflare side); steps 5 to 7 happen in a **separate assistant-ui frontend**. You'll have two dev processes running by the end: `wrangler dev` for the Worker, and your frontend's dev server.

1. ### Scaffold the Worker project

   ```
   npm create cloudflare@latest my-agent -- --type=hello-world --ts
   cd my-agent
   ```

   Add the Cloudflare Agents packages and the AI SDK:

   ```bash
   npm install agents@0.12.4 @cloudflare/ai-chat@0.7.0 ai@latest @ai-sdk/openai@latest
   ```

   The two Cloudflare packages above are pinned to exact versions because `agents` and `@cloudflare/ai-chat` are pre-1.0 and ship breaking changes between minor releases. See [version stability](#version-stability) below before bumping them.

2. ### Define the agent

   `AIChatAgent` already implements message persistence, streaming protocol, and WebSocket plumbing. Override `onChatMessage` to plug in your model and tools.

   ```
   import { AIChatAgent } from "@cloudflare/ai-chat";
   import { openai } from "@ai-sdk/openai";
   import { streamText, convertToModelMessages } from "ai";

   export type Env = {
     OPENAI_API_KEY: string;
     Chat: DurableObjectNamespace<Chat>;
   };

   export class Chat extends AIChatAgent<Env> {
     async onChatMessage(onFinish: Parameters<typeof streamText>[0]["onFinish"]) {
       return streamText({
         model: openai("gpt-5.6-luna"),
         messages: await convertToModelMessages(this.messages),
         onFinish,
       });
     }
   }
   ```

   `Env` is exported alongside `Chat` so the Worker entry point can reuse the same type. The `Chat: DurableObjectNamespace<Chat>` field mirrors the binding declared in `wrangler.jsonc` (next step) and is what `routeAgentRequest` looks up to resolve the agent. `DurableObjectNamespace` is a global from `@cloudflare/workers-types`, which the `npm create cloudflare` scaffold sets up by default.

   `this.messages` is the persisted history for this Durable Object instance. Each unique agent `name` you connect with from the client (step 7) gets its own instance and its own message log.

3. ### Register the Durable Object and route requests

   ```
   import { routeAgentRequest } from "agents";
   import { Chat, type Env } from "./chat";

   export { Chat };

   const cors = (request: Request) => ({
     "Access-Control-Allow-Origin": request.headers.get("Origin") ?? "*",
     "Access-Control-Allow-Headers": "Content-Type, Upgrade",
     "Access-Control-Allow-Methods": "GET, POST, OPTIONS",
   });

   export default {
     async fetch(request: Request, env: Env): Promise<Response> {
       if (request.method === "OPTIONS") {
         return new Response(null, { headers: cors(request) });
       }
       const upstream =
         (await routeAgentRequest(request, env)) ??
         new Response("Not found", { status: 404 });
       const res = new Response(upstream.body, upstream);
       for (const [k, v] of Object.entries(cors(request))) res.headers.set(k, v);
       return res;
     },
   } satisfies ExportedHandler<Env>;
   ```

   `routeAgentRequest` handles WebSocket upgrades, agent lookup by URL path, and the `/get-messages` HTTP endpoint that the frontend uses for history rehydration. The `cors` helper reflects the request origin so the frontend can talk to the Worker across ports during local development. WebSocket upgrades bypass CORS in the browser, but the `/get-messages` HTTP fetch and any custom routes need these headers. For production, replace the wildcard fallback with an explicit allowlist.

   Wire the Durable Object binding in `wrangler.jsonc`:

   ```
   {
     "name": "my-agent",
     "main": "src/index.ts",
     "compatibility_date": "2026-01-01",
     "compatibility_flags": ["nodejs_compat"],
     "durable_objects": {
       "bindings": [{ "name": "Chat", "class_name": "Chat" }]
     },
     "migrations": [
       { "tag": "v1", "new_sqlite_classes": ["Chat"] }
     ]
   }
   ```

   The binding `name` and `class_name` must match the exported class. `new_sqlite_classes` is required so the Durable Object can use SQLite for message storage.

4. ### Run the Worker locally

   Local `wrangler dev` reads environment variables from a `.dev.vars` file in the project root (not from the remote secret store):

   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
   ```

   ```
   wrangler dev
   ```

   For production, upload the same key as a deployed Worker secret before `wrangler deploy`:

   ```
   wrangler secret put OPENAI_API_KEY
   ```

   The Worker boots on `http://localhost:8787`. Leave it running.

5. ### Initialize the assistant-ui frontend

   In a different directory:

   ```
   npx assistant-ui@latest create
   ```

   ```
   npx assistant-ui@latest init
   ```

   This creates a default chat page and a local API route at `app/api/chat/route.ts`. You won't use the local route, since the agent runs on the Worker; delete it once the next step is wired.

6. ### Install the Cloudflare client packages

   In the frontend project:

   ```bash
   npm install agents@0.12.4 @cloudflare/ai-chat@0.7.0
   ```

7. ### Wire the runtime

   ```
   "use client";

   import { useAgent } from "agents/react";
   import { useAgentChat } from "@cloudflare/ai-chat/react";
   import { AssistantRuntimeProvider } from "@assistant-ui/react";
   import { useAISDKRuntime } from "@assistant-ui/react-ai-sdk";
   import { Thread } from "@/components/assistant-ui/thread";

   export const Assistant = () => {
     const agent = useAgent({
       agent: "Chat",
       name: "default",
       host: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_AGENT_HOST!,
     });
     const chat = useAgentChat({ agent });
     const runtime = useAISDKRuntime(chat);

     return (
       <AssistantRuntimeProvider runtime={runtime}>
         <Thread />
       </AssistantRuntimeProvider>
     );
   };
   ```

   Set the Worker URL in your frontend environment:

   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_AGENT_HOST=http://localhost:8787
   ```

   `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` exposes the value to the browser. In production, point this at your deployed Worker (e.g. `https://my-agent.example.workers.dev`).

   `name: "default"` is the Durable Object instance key. Pass a per-user value (a user ID, session ID, or chat ID) to give each user their own persisted history. Switching `name` from the client opens a new WebSocket connection to a different Durable Object instance.

## Notes

### Type compatibility with `useChat`

`useAgentChat`'s return type is `Omit<ReturnType<typeof useChat>, "addToolOutput"> & { ... }`. The `addToolOutput` option shape differs slightly between the two: `useChat` accepts `{ state, tool, toolCallId, ... }`; `useAgentChat` accepts `{ state, toolCallId, toolName?, ... }`. At runtime the call paths converge through `useAISDKRuntime` without issue (verified against `@cloudflare/ai-chat@0.7.0`). If the TypeScript compiler flags the call, cast at the call site: `useAISDKRuntime(chat as Parameters<typeof useAISDKRuntime>[0])`, or `chat as unknown as Parameters<typeof useAISDKRuntime>[0]` if TypeScript still refuses the direct cast. (`satisfies` does not help here; it validates assignability without changing the inferred type, so it surfaces the same error.)

### Cloudflare-specific extras

`useAgentChat` exposes three values that `useChat` does not:

- `clearHistory()` sends a `cf_agent_chat_clear` frame and wipes the Durable Object's SQLite store. Bind it to a "Clear chat" button if you need server-side history reset; `setMessages([])` alone only clears the client view.
- `isServerStreaming` is `true` while the server is pushing tokens, independent of client-initiated request state. Use it for a universal streaming indicator.
- `isToolContinuation` distinguishes "server auto-continuing after a tool result" from "user just sent a new message". Useful for typing-indicator gating.

Destructure these alongside `chat` and pass them into your UI directly; they don't need to flow through the runtime.

### `setMessages` round-trips through the Durable Object

`useAgentChat` overrides `setMessages` to broadcast the new list over the WebSocket so the Durable Object's SQLite history stays in sync. This means assistant-ui's `onImport`, `onEdit`, `onReload`, and pending-tool cancellation paths all persist server-side automatically. The tradeoff is one extra WebSocket round-trip per mutation, which can race if the connection is lagging; assume eventual consistency, not transactional.

### Authenticate the Worker before going to production

`routeAgentRequest` accepts any client that knows the agent class and `name`. If you derive `name` from a user ID (as recommended for per-user history), any client that knows or guesses another user's ID can connect to that Durable Object and read its full message log. Before deploying:

- Gate the fetch handler with a header or cookie check (e.g. a JWT issued by your auth backend), and only call `routeAgentRequest` after the request is authenticated.
- Pass the same credential from the frontend via `useAgent`'s `headers` or `query` options so the WebSocket upgrade carries it.
- Tighten the CORS `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` to an explicit allowlist; the wildcard in the example above is for local development only.

### Version stability

`agents` and `@cloudflare/ai-chat` are pre-1.0 and ship breaking changes between minor versions. Pin both to exact versions in `package.json` and read the Cloudflare changelog before bumping. The `useAgentChat` return shape has been additive since 0.3.0, so the integration above should keep working across patch releases.
