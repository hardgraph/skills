## Update network rules for the new authorization header

**Who is affected:** users with a network proxy or firewall that inspects or filters traffic based on the `Control-Plane-Bearer` HTTP header name.

### What Changed

The Control Plane now uses the standard `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header when communicating with Gatling Cloud. The proprietary `Control-Plane-Bearer` header is no longer sent.

### Migration Guide

Update your proxy or firewall rules to allow `Authorization: Bearer` instead.

Standard configurations without custom network filtering require no changes.
