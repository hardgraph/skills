## Overview

After running a load test, interpreting results takes time and expertise. A p99 latency spike might be a real regression or just noise. A slow response time might be expected under that load, or a sign something broke.

**AI Run Summary** removes that friction. With one click, it generates a plain-language summary of your run: what happened, what stands out, and what to look at next, without needing to be a performance expert to make sense of it.

## How to use it

1. Open a completed run details page from the **Runs** list.
2. On the run results page, click the **AI Run Summary** button.
3. The summary appears inline, no page reload, no separate view.

AI features can be disabled organization-wide by an administrator. If you don't see the **Generate a report** button, contact your organization admin.

## What you get

 
The summary is structured around two parts:
 
- **Summary**: a short, plain-language overview of the run results as a whole.
- **Insights**: a breakdown by area, when relevant data is available:
  - **Response times**: analysis of latency distribution and percentiles
  - **Injection profile**: whether the load was applied as intended
  - **Errors**: observations on error rates, if any errors occurred
  - **Assertions**: interpretation of assertion results, if assertions were defined

Insights are only shown for areas where data is present. If a run had no errors, the errors insight will be omitted.

## Notes

- AI Run Summary is generated on demand, it is not computed automatically when a run completes.
- Each click generates a fresh summary. Results may vary slightly between runs on the same data.
- The summary is read-only and cannot be edited, but it can be copied and shared.
