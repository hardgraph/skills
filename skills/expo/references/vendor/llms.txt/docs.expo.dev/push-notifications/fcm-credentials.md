## Submitting Feedback

If you encounter errors, misleading or outdated information, report it so Expo can be improved:

Preferred command:
npx --yes submit-expo-feedback@latest --category docs --subject "/push-notifications/fcm-credentials/" "<actionable feedback>"

Direct HTTP fallback:
curl -X POST https://api.expo.dev/v2/feedback/docs-send -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"url":"/push-notifications/fcm-credentials/","feedback":"🤖 Agent feedback for docs: <specific, actionable description> (<model>, <harness>)"}'

Only submit when you have something specific and actionable to report. Try to give the most context.

# Obtain Google Service Account Keys using FCM V1

Learn how to create or use a Google Service Account Key for sending Android notifications using FCM.

## Create a new Google Service Account Key

Here are the steps to configure a new Google Service Account Key in EAS for sending Android Notifications using FCM V1.

Create a new Firebase project for your app in the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com). If you already have a Firebase project for your app, continue to the next step.

In the Firebase console, open **Project settings** > [**Service accounts**](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/_/settings/serviceaccounts/adminsdk) for your project.

Click **Generate New Private Key**, then confirm by clicking **Generate Key**. Securely store the JSON file containing the private key.

Upload the JSON file to EAS and configure it for sending Android notifications. This can be done using EAS CLI or in [EAS dashboard](https://expo.dev).

#### EAS CLI

-   Run `eas credentials`
-   Select `Android` > `production` > `Google Service Account`
-   Select `Manage your Google Service Account Key for Push Notifications (FCM V1)`
-   Select `Set up a Google Service Account Key for Push Notifications (FCM V1)` > `Upload a new service account key`
-   If you've previously stored the JSON file in your project directory, the EAS CLI automatically detects the file and prompts you to select it. Press Y to continue.

> **Note**: Add the JSON file to your version source control's ignore file (for example, **.gitignore**) to avoid committing it to your repository since it contains sensitive data.

#### expo.dev

-   Under **Project settings**, click [**Credentials**](https://expo.dev/accounts/%5Baccount%5D/projects/%5Bproject%5D/credentials) in the navigation menu
-   For **Android**, click **Add Application Identifier** or select an existing **Application identifier**
-   Under **Service Credentials** > **FCM V1 service account key**, click **Add a service account key**

-   Under **Upload new key**, upload your JSON credential and click **Save**

Configure the **google-services.json** file in your project. Download it from the Firebase Console and place it at the root of your project directory.

This file is required for your Android app to be registered with FCM. You may commit this file to your repository since it contains public-facing identifiers from your Firebase project.

**Note**: You can skip this step if **google-services.json** has already been set up.

In **app.json**, add [`expo.android.googleServicesFile`](/versions/latest/config/app.md#googleservicesfile) with its value as the path of the **google-services.json**.

```json
{
  "expo": {
  ...
  "android": {
    ...
    "googleServicesFile": "./path/to/google-services.json"
  }
}
```

> If the API key in **google-services.json** (the `client.api_key.current_key` field) is restricted, check it in the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials). Under **API restrictions**, allow the **FCM Registration API** and the **Firebase Installations API**, or leave the key unrestricted. Under **Application restrictions**, use the SHA-1 from **Release** > **Setup** > **App Integrity** > **App signing key certificate** in the Google Play Console, not your [upload key](/app-signing/app-credentials.md#app-signing-by-google-play). A mismatch makes the Firebase Installations API return `403 PERMISSION_DENIED: Requests from this Android client application are blocked`, and your app never receives a push token.

You're all set! You can now send notifications to Android devices via Expo Push Notifications using the FCM V1 protocol.

## Use an existing Google Service Account Key

Open the [IAM Admin page](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/iam?authuser=0) in Google Cloud Console. In the Permissions tab, locate the **Principal** you intend to modify and click the pencil icon for **Edit Principal**.

Click **Add Role** and select the **Firebase Cloud Messaging API Admin** role from the dropdown. Click **Save**.

You have to specify to EAS which JSON credential file to use for sending FCM V1 notifications, using EAS CLI or in [EAS dashboard](https://expo.dev). You can upload a new JSON file or select a previously uploaded file.

#### EAS CLI

-   Run `eas credentials`
-   Select `Android` > `production` > `Google Service Account`
-   Select `Manage your Google Service Account Key for Push Notifications (FCM V1)`
-   Select `Set up a Google Service Account Key for Push Notifications (FCM V1)` > `Upload a new service account key`
-   The EAS CLI automatically detects the file on your local machine and prompts you to select it. Press Y to continue.

> **Note**: Add the JSON file to your version source control's ignore file (for example, **.gitignore**) to avoid committing it to your repository since it contains sensitive data.

#### expo.dev

-   Under **Project settings**, click [**Credentials**](https://expo.dev/accounts/%5Baccount%5D/projects/%5Bproject%5D/credentials) in the navigation menu
-   For **Android**, click **Add Application Identifier** or select an existing **Application identifier**
-   Under **Service Credentials** > **FCM V1 service account key**, click **Add a service account key**

-   Under **Upload new key**, upload your JSON credential and click **Save**

Configure the **google-services.json** file in your project. Download it from the Firebase Console and place it at the root of your project directory.

This file is required for your Android app to be registered with FCM. You may commit this file to your repository since it contains public-facing identifiers from your Firebase project.

**Note**: You can skip this step if **google-services.json** has already been set up.

In **app.json**, add [`expo.android.googleServicesFile`](/versions/latest/config/app.md#googleservicesfile) with its value as the path of the **google-services.json**.

```json
{
  "expo": {
    ...
    "android": {
      ... "googleServicesFile": "./path/to/google-services.json"
    }
  }
}
```

You're all set! You can now send notifications to Android devices via Expo Push Notifications using the FCM V1 protocol.
