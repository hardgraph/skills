## Replace `working-directory` with `executable-dir`

**Who is affected:** users with dedicated machines private locations using the `working-directory` configuration key.

### What Changed

The `working-directory` config key is deprecated and replaced by `executable-dir`, aligning dedicated machines with all other location types.

### Migration Guide

Replace `working-directory` with `executable-dir` in your Control Plane configuration:

#### Old Configuration

```hocon
control-plane {
  locations = [
    {
      id = "<location-dedicated-id>"
      type = "dedicated-machines"
      working-directory = "/opt/gatling"
    }
  ]
}
```

#### New Configuration

```hocon
control-plane {
  locations = [
    {
      id = "<location-dedicated-id>"
      type = "dedicated-machines"
      executable-dir = "/opt/gatling"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Backward Compatibility

If `executable-dir` is absent, the Control Plane falls back to `working-directory`. However, `working-directory` is deprecated and will be removed in a future release.
