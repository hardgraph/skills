# Separate server integration
URL: /docs/integrations/frameworks/mastra/separate-server

Run Mastra as a standalone server with assistant-ui as a separate frontend.

> For AI agents: a documentation index is available at [llms.txt](/llms.txt). Use `.md` for canonical markdown pages; `.mdx` is kept as a backwards-compatible alias on supported URL paths.

Run Mastra as its own service and have the assistant-ui frontend hit it over HTTP. The two halves can deploy, scale, and version independently. The tradeoff is one extra hop and CORS to configure.

For the simpler in-process variant, see [full-stack](/docs/integrations/frameworks/mastra/full-stack) instead.

## Setup

The setup has two halves. Steps 1 to 4 happen in the **Mastra server** project; steps 5 to 7 happen in a **separate assistant-ui frontend** project. You'll have two terminals open by the end: one for each dev server.

1. ### Create the Mastra server project

   In a directory separate from your frontend, scaffold a Mastra project:

   ```
   npx create-mastra@latest
   ```

   Follow the wizard's prompts. When it finishes, change into the new directory and add the AI SDK adapter:

   ```
   cd your-mastra-server
   ```

   ```bash
   npm install @mastra/ai-sdk@latest
   ```

   Set the model provider keys (`OPENAI_API_KEY`, etc.) in `.env.development`. The `create-mastra` wizard prompts for some keys, but verify all the providers you plan to call are present.

2. ### Define an agent

   ```
   import { Agent } from "@mastra/core/agent";

   export const chefAgent = new Agent({
     name: "chef-agent",
     instructions:
       "You are Michel, a practical and experienced home chef. " +
       "You help people cook with whatever ingredients they have available.",
     model: "openai/gpt-5.6-luna",
   });
   ```

3. ### Register the agent, chat route, and CORS

   Open the Mastra entry point. You will set three things in the same `Mastra` constructor: the agent, a chat route, and CORS for the frontend's origin.

   ```
   import { Mastra } from "@mastra/core";
   import { chefAgent } from "./agents/chefAgent";
   import { chatRoute } from "@mastra/ai-sdk";

   export const mastra = new Mastra({
     agents: { chefAgent },
     server: {
       cors: {
         origin: process.env.FRONTEND_ORIGIN ?? "http://localhost:3000",
         credentials: true,
       },
       apiRoutes: [
         chatRoute({ path: "/chat/:agentId" }),
       ],
     },
   });
   ```

   A few things to note:

   - `:agentId` matches the **JavaScript key** in the `agents` object, not the agent's `name` field. So `chefAgent` is reachable at `/chat/chefAgent` (camelCase), not `/chat/chef-agent`.
   - Add more agents to the `agents` object and they all become callable through this single route.
   - `FRONTEND_ORIGIN` should be set to your deployed frontend's URL in production. Without CORS configured, the browser blocks the request and the chat silently fails.

4. ### Run the Mastra server

   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

   The server starts on `http://localhost:4111` by default. Leave it running for the rest of the steps.

5. ### Initialize the assistant-ui frontend

   In a **different directory** from the Mastra server, scaffold the frontend:

   ```
   npx assistant-ui@latest create
   ```

   ```
   npx assistant-ui@latest init
   ```

   This creates a default chat page and a local API route at `app/api/chat/route.ts`. You won't use the local route, since the agent runs on the separate Mastra server; delete it once the next step is wired.

6. ### Point the runtime at the Mastra server

   Open the file containing `useChatRuntime` (typically `app/assistant.tsx`) and pass an explicit `api` URL:

   ```
   "use client";

   import { AssistantRuntimeProvider } from "@assistant-ui/react";
   import { AssistantChatTransport, useChatRuntime } from "@assistant-ui/react-ai-sdk";
   import { Thread } from "@/components/assistant-ui/thread";

   export const Assistant = () => {
     const runtime = useChatRuntime({
       transport: new AssistantChatTransport({
         api: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_MASTRA_URL!,
       }),
     });

     return (
       <AssistantRuntimeProvider runtime={runtime}>
         <Thread />
       </AssistantRuntimeProvider>
     );
   };
   ```

   Set the URL in your frontend's environment:

   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_MASTRA_URL=http://localhost:4111/chat/chefAgent
   ```

   `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` makes the URL available in the browser. In production, point this at your deployed Mastra server. Mastra itself uses `.env.development` for its server keys; the two projects keep separate environment files.

7. ### Run and verify

   Make sure the Mastra server (step 4) is still running in its own terminal, then start the frontend in a new terminal:

   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

   Open `http://localhost:3000`, send a message, and confirm:

   - The response streams in token by token.
   - The network tab shows the `POST` going to `http://localhost:4111/chat/chefAgent`, not the local `/api/chat`.
   - No CORS errors in the console; if you see `blocked by CORS policy`, revisit step 3.

## Notes

- **Auth between frontend and Mastra**: the example above is open. In production, gate the Mastra route with a header or cookie check and forward credentials from the frontend (`AssistantChatTransport` accepts `headers` and `credentials` options).
- **Single agent vs router**: `chatRoute({ path: "/chat/:agentId" })` works for any agent registered on the `Mastra` instance. Switching agents from the frontend is a matter of pointing `NEXT_PUBLIC_MASTRA_URL` at a different agent ID.
- **Advanced Mastra features** (memory, tools, workflows, evals) live in the agent definition. The frontend sees only the resulting stream. See the [Mastra docs](https://mastra.ai/docs).
