Trace AI SDK calls into LangSmith with the wrapAISDK helper.

[LangSmith](https://www.langchain.com/langsmith) is LangChain's observability and eval platform. If you are already in the LangChain or LangGraph ecosystem, LangSmith is the natural pairing: traces, datasets, prompt versioning, and LLM-as-judge evals share state with the rest of the LangChain stack.

This page covers the **AI SDK** path. If you use [`@assistant-ui/react-langgraph`](/docs/runtimes/langgraph/overview), tracing flows through LangGraph Cloud automatically; you only need this guide when your route handler talks to AI SDK directly.

## How it works

LangSmith provides a wrapper around the `ai` namespace. You call `wrapAISDK(ai)`, get back the same exports (`generateText`, `streamText`, `generateObject`, `streamObject`), and use those in place of the originals. Every call is then traced.

## Setup

1. ### Get LangSmith credentials

   Sign up at [smith.langchain.com](https://smith.langchain.com/) and copy an API key from settings.

   ```
   LANGSMITH_TRACING=true
   LANGSMITH_API_KEY=lsv2_pt_...
   LANGSMITH_PROJECT=assistant-ui
   ```

   `LANGSMITH_PROJECT` controls which project receives traces; the default project applies if you omit it. See LangSmith's [project configuration guide](https://docs.langchain.com/langsmith/log-traces-to-project) for details.

2. ### Install the LangSmith SDK

   ```bash
   npm install langsmith
   ```

3. ### Wrap the AI SDK

   `wrapAISDK` re-exports `generateText`, `streamText`, `generateObject`, and `streamObject` with tracing enabled. Use the wrapped versions in your route.

   ```
   import * as ai from "ai";
   import { wrapAISDK } from "langsmith/experimental/vercel";
   import { openai } from "@ai-sdk/openai";
   import type { UIMessage } from "ai";

   const { streamText } = wrapAISDK(ai);

   export async function POST(req: Request) {
     const { messages }: { messages: UIMessage[] } = await req.json();

     const result = streamText({
       model: openai("gpt-5.6-luna"),
       messages: await ai.convertToModelMessages(messages),
     });

     return result.toUIMessageStreamResponse();
   }
   ```

   `convertToModelMessages` is not part of the wrapper, so import it from `ai` directly.

4. ### Add metadata for grouping (optional)

   Pass a `langsmith` provider option to tag traces with user, session, or run identifiers. Use `createLangSmithProviderOptions` to build the value:

   ```
   import { createLangSmithProviderOptions } from "langsmith/experimental/vercel";

   const result = streamText({
     model: openai("gpt-5.6-luna"),
     messages: await ai.convertToModelMessages(messages),
     providerOptions: {
       langsmith: createLangSmithProviderOptions({
         name: "chat-completion",
         metadata: { userId, threadId },
       }),
     },
   });
   ```

   `name` becomes the run name in LangSmith. Traces filter by the metadata fields you pass; resolve `userId` and `threadId` from your auth and thread state, don't ship literal strings.

5. ### Run and verify

   Send a message. The trace should appear in your LangSmith project within seconds. Confirm:

   - A new run named according to `name` (or the default `streamText`).
   - Inputs (messages), outputs (completion), token usage, and latency are populated.
   - Metadata fields appear as filters.

## Notes

- **Serverless flush.** Serverless functions exit before LangSmith flushes batched traces. Before returning, force the flush with the `Client` from `langsmith`:

  ```
  import { Client } from "langsmith";
  const client = new Client();
  // ...inside your route handler, after streamText:
  await client.awaitPendingTraceBatches();
  ```

  Without this you will lose traces on Vercel, AWS Lambda, and similar platforms.

- **`experimental_telemetry` vs `wrapAISDK`.** The AI SDK has a generic `experimental_telemetry` flag that emits OpenTelemetry spans (used by [Langfuse](/docs/integrations/observability/langfuse)). `wrapAISDK` is LangSmith's own path; you do not need to set `experimental_telemetry` when using it.

- **LangGraph users.** If your backend is LangGraph Cloud, prefer the LangGraph runtime; tracing is built in. Use `wrapAISDK` only when calling AI SDK directly outside of LangGraph.

- **Version requirements.** LangSmith documents AI SDK v5 as the minimum and `langsmith >= 0.3.63`. The wrapper continues to work against v6 in practice; if you hit an incompatibility, check LangSmith's release notes.
