## What is a campaign?

A campaign is a named group of tests organised around a concrete performance purpose meeting your needs.

Where a single test run tells you how a feature performs at a given moment, a campaign tells you whether your system is consistently meeting a defined standard over time. Each time a test belonging to a campaign completes a run, a **campaign score** is computed and added to the score trend, giving you an evolving picture of your system's performance health.

The score is broken down into three categories (**Methodology**, **Objectives**, and **Confidence**), each of which surfaces specific, actionable improvements. A low score always points to something concrete you can act on.
