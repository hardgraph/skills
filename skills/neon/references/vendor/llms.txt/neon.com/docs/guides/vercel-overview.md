> Summary: Lakebase Postgres-Vercel integration decision guide covering three connection paths: Vercel-Managed (new users, billing through Vercel), Neon-Managed (existing Neon account, billing through Neon), and Manual (custom CI/CD via env vars). Both managed integrations auto-provision Lakebase Postgres database branches for Vercel preview deployments and support Managed Better Auth; they differ in branch cleanup timing, where Vercel-Managed follows deployment retention policy and Neon-Managed triggers on Git branch deletion. Choose this page to select the right integration before following the path-specific setup guide.

# Integrating Neon with Vercel

Choose the right connection path in seconds

## Overview

This page helps you quickly choose the best Neon–Vercel integration for your project. Whether you're starting fresh or have existing infrastructure, we'll guide you to the right solution.

**Tip: Quick decision guide**

Choose the **Vercel-Managed Integration** if you're new to Neon and want unified billing through Vercel.
Choose the **Neon-Managed Integration** if you already have a Neon account or prefer to manage billing directly with Neon.

**Note: Branch cleanup timing**

Branch cleanup behavior differs between the two integrations. Vercel-Managed cleanup depends on Vercel's deployment retention policy, which can delay branch deletion by months. Neon-Managed cleanup is triggered by Git branch deletion. See [Managing Vercel preview branch cleanup](https://neon.com/docs/guides/vercel-branch-cleanup) for details, workarounds, and recommendations.

## Choose your integration path

**Important: Do you need custom CI/CD control?**

**If you want to build preview branching into your own CI/CD pipelines (for example, via GitHub Actions)**, use a **[manual connection](https://neon.com/docs/guides/vercel-manual)** instead of the automated integrations below.

For automated integrations, follow this simple flow:

## Do you have an existing Neon account?

**Do you already have a Neon account or project you want to keep using?**

- **✅ Yes** → Use **[Neon-Managed Integration](https://neon.com/docs/guides/neon-managed-vercel-integration)**
- **❌ No** → Continue below

## Choose your billing preference

**Where would you like to manage billing for Neon?**

- **Through my Vercel account** → Use **[Vercel-Managed Integration](https://neon.com/docs/guides/vercel-managed-integration)**
- **Directly with Neon** → Use **[Neon-Managed Integration](https://neon.com/docs/guides/neon-managed-vercel-integration)**
