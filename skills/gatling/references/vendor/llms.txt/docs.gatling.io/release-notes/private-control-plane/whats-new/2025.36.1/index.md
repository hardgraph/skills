## Validate proxy TLS keystore and truststore at startup

Keystore and truststore files configured under `control-plane.enterprise-cloud.proxy` are now validated at startup. Only PKCS12 and PEM formats are accepted. JKS is now explicitly rejected: it was previously accepted but caused load generators to fail silently, since they use curl which does not support JKS.

See the [upgrade guide]({{< ref "/release-notes/private-control-plane/upgrading/to-2025.36.1" >}}).

## Restrict Kubernetes pod log forwarding

Kubernetes load generator pod logs are no longer forwarded to Gatling Cloud. Sensitive URL parameters that may appear in pod logs are now retained locally on the Control Plane only.

## Fix unexpected builds triggered by the wrong Control Plane

Fixed unexpected builds or deployments being triggered by a Control Plane that was not the intended owner of the task.
